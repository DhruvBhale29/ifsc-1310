      <h2>Project Improvements and Reflections</h2>
      <p>After receiving feedback on my draft version of the Mars Rover project, I made several improvements based on both peer and personal evaluation. One major area of improvement was organization—headings, content layout, and images were refined to improve accessibility and readability.</p>

      <p>One of the most lengthy revisions was based on a peer’s suggestion to change the header image and make it larger. While resizing was straightforward, finding a suitable replacement image was challenging. After some effort, I finally found one that fit the theme.</p>

      <p>I added a third rover (Spirit) to give a more complete view of Mars exploration history. I also fixed links such as the “Back to Top” anchor. While not technically broken, it originally targeted the "h1" tag because of the ID i put in it, which wasn’t ideal. I corrected this by removing the ID from the "header" element. I also improved the navigation layout by making the links resemble buttons. Additionally, I implemented feedback from the professor regarding the main content margin for better spacing.</p>

      <p>Visually, I improved spacing, typography, and applied consistent styling using a single CSS file. I ensured all images had appropriate "alt" text and used valid semantic HTML elements. I validated the site using the W3C validator and corrected all errors and warnings.</p>

      <p>A friend pointed out that the FAQ section had no visual separation, and the headings looked similar to the body text. I resolved this by styling FAQ questions with a custom CSS class. They also mentioned that images were too large and lacked captions, so I reduced image sizes and provided more descriptive "alt" attributes to support screen readers.</p>

      <p>Some suggestions I chose not to implement included adding collapsible FAQ sections using JavaScript. I wanted to keep the project simple and maintain accessibility without requiring scripting.</p>

      <p>From this project, I learned how important it is to design not just for appearance but also for functionality and accessibility. If I were to start over, I would plan the structure more carefully from the beginning instead of revising heavily later.</p>
