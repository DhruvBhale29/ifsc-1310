      <p>For me, progressive enhancement is about starting simple, focusing on core content first, then layering on styling and functionality for those who can use it. It’s about making sure that, no matter the device or browser, everyone has access to the essential parts of the site.</p>

      <p>The analogy that clicked for me was Aaron Gustafson’s Peanut M&M comparison: The peanut is the content (the foundation), the chocolate is the CSS (style), and the candy shell is JavaScript (interactivity). Even if someone doesn’t get the chocolate or candy shell, the peanut is still there.</p>

      <p>This approach is all about inclusivity. Whether someone is using an old phone, a screen reader, or has JavaScript disabled, progressive enhancement ensures that the experience remains usable and accessible. It’s a mindset that’s practical, respectful, and keeps the code clean.</p>

      <p>In my own projects, this approach has shifted how I prioritize. Instead of focusing on flashy features, I now ask, “What’s essential here?” and “How can I make sure everyone can access it?” It really changes the way I approach web development.</p>

      <p>I found a great explanation on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_enhancement" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> that expands on the topic with real-world examples and practical tips.</p>
