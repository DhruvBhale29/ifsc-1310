      <h2>Welcome to the Mars Rover Program</h2>
      <p>The Mars Rover program is a cornerstone of NASA's exploration of the Red Planet. These robotic scientists traverse the Martian terrain, conducting experiments and collecting invaluable data that help us understand Mars' geology and climate, and assess its past and present potential to support life.</p>

    <p>Launched in 2011 and landing in Gale Crater in August 2012, Curiosity is a nuclear-powered, car-sized rover built to explore Mars' climate and geology. Its mission includes investigating Marsâ€™ habitability, studying its climate and geology, and preparing for future human exploration.</p>
    <p>Key features include its 2.1-meter robotic arm, onboard laboratory for chemical analysis, and advanced camera systems. Curiosity has uncovered strong evidence of ancient freshwater lakes and complex organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life. It continues to explore Mount Sharp, providing valuable data on Mars' sedimentary layers and environmental history.</p>

    <p>Perseverance launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. It is designed to search for signs of ancient life, collect and cache samples for possible return to Earth, and test new technologies for future missions.</p>
    <p>Among its cutting-edge technologies are the MOXIE experiment (which produces oxygen from the Martian atmosphere), advanced sample caching systems, and the first onboard microphones to record Mars sounds. Perseverance also deployed the Ingenuity helicopter, which achieved the first powered flight on another planet. The rover is currently traversing the delta of an ancient river, analyzing sediment for signs of past microbial life.</p>
