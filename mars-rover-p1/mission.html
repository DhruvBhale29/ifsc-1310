      <h2>Pioneering the Path: Early Missions</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Sojourner (1997)</h3>
        <p>Part of NASA’s Mars Pathfinder mission, Sojourner became the first successful Mars rover, landing on July 4, 1997. Though small, Sojourner provided valuable data on Martian soil mechanics, atmosphere, and rocks using its onboard instruments and cameras.</p>

        <h3>Spirit & Opportunity (2004)</h3>
        <p>Spirit (MER-A) and Opportunity (MER-B) were twin rovers launched in 2003 and landed in January 2004. They vastly exceeded expectations, operating far beyond their original 90-day missions. Spirit explored Gusev Crater for over 6 years, while Opportunity roamed Meridiani Planum for nearly 15 years, breaking records for distance and endurance.</p>

      <h2>The Age of Advanced Science</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Curiosity (2012 – Present)</h3>
        <p>Curiosity marked a major leap in rover design, equipped with a nuclear power source and a sophisticated science lab. Since landing in Gale Crater in 2012, it has been studying the layered terrain of Mount Sharp and delivering crucial evidence of ancient lakes and habitability.</p>

        <h3>Perseverance (2021 – Present)</h3>
        <p>The most advanced Mars rover to date, Perseverance landed in Jezero Crater in 2021. It is tasked with searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting samples for future return to Earth. Its accomplishments include deploying the Ingenuity helicopter and producing oxygen on Mars using MOXIE.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>Future Mars missions will build on the successes of these rovers. NASA and international partners are planning missions to retrieve cached samples, and ultimately, send humans to Mars. Each rover has contributed significantly to paving the way for these monumental steps in space exploration.</p>
