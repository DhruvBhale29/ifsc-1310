        <h2>Landing & Navigation</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>How do Mars rovers land on the planet?</h3>
          <p>Mars rovers use a combination of heat shields, parachutes, retrorockets, and sky crane systems to slow their descent and land safely on the Martian surface.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>How do Mars rovers navigate the terrain?</h3>
          <p>Rovers use a combination of pre-programmed routes, hazard-avoidance cameras, and autonomous navigation systems to travel across the Martian landscape while avoiding obstacles like rocks and sand traps.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Can Mars rovers be controlled in real time?</h3>
          <p>No, due to the time delay in signals traveling between Earth and Mars, real-time control isn't possible. Commands are sent in batches, and the rover operates semi-autonomously between updates.</p>
        </article>
      </div>

      <!-- Technology & Power -->
      <div class="faq-group">
        <h2>Technology & Power</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>What powers the Mars rovers?</h3>
          <p>Rovers like Spirit and Opportunity used solar panels, while Curiosity and Perseverance are powered by nuclear generators called RTGs (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators).</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>What scientific tools do rovers carry?</h3>
          <p>They are equipped with cameras, spectrometers, drills, environmental sensors, and onboard laboratories to study rocks, soil, and the atmosphere.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>What is the Ingenuity helicopter?</h3>
          <p>Ingenuity is a small drone carried by Perseverance, which achieved the first powered flight on another planet. It serves as a technology demonstration for future aerial exploration.</p>
        </article>
      </div>

      <!-- Science & Discoveries -->
      <div class="faq-group">
        <h2>Science & Discoveries</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Why is Jezero Crater important?</h3>
          <p>Jezero Crater once housed a river delta, making it a prime location for searching for ancient microbial life and collecting sedimentary samples.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>What are some discoveries made by the rovers?</h3>
          <p>Rovers have discovered evidence of ancient water flows, detected complex organic molecules, measured radiation levels, and provided insights into Marsâ€™ climate history and potential habitability.</p>
        </article>
      </div>

      <!-- Mission Details -->
      <div class="faq-group">
        <h2>Mission Details</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>What is the main goal of the Mars 2020 mission?</h3>
          <p>The Mars 2020 mission, featuring the Perseverance rover, aims to search for signs of ancient life, collect rock and soil samples, and test new technology to prepare for future human exploration.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>How long do Mars rover missions typically last?</h3>
          <p>While missions are designed with conservative timeframes (like 90 days for Spirit and Opportunity), many have far outlasted expectations. Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, and Curiosity and Perseverance continue to function years after landing.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>What happens to rovers when their missions end?</h3>
          <p>Once rovers lose power or stop communicating, they remain on the Martian surface as stationary monuments to human achievement. They are studied remotely to understand their failures and build better missions in the future.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>How do rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
          <p>Rovers send data to orbiters around Mars, which then relay the information to Earth using high-gain antennas. Communication is delayed due to the distance between the planets.</p>
